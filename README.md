# budget

Finally, an exciting budget application that lets tue user input transaction items, along with the value of said item. But wait!!! There's more! Not only are these items reflected in a mighty fine graph, but they are also able to be adjusted while working offline! At last you can work on your budget when you have no connection because you're stuck in a subway tunnel or `(insert plausible scenario here)`!

## About the Project

budget is a financing application project designed to get data from a user, namedly a transaction name and transaction value. The application then will save the data in a `budget` database, determine how what the running total of all transcations are and populate the value for total at the top of the page. When a connection is not available to the user's device, the appliation will utilize a service handler to enable offline functionality and catch-up the data once a connection is re-established. Did I mention the pretty chart and table? It has a pretty chart and a table, also.

## Getting Started

To get started you'll need to have a connection in order to initialize the application. After the application has been initialized for the very first time by making an input while connected, the application will have the ability to be utilized offline. Make fund additions or subtractions as needed and the application will continue to function and will keep track of the transactions. If a connection is lost the application will remain functional and display information just as if it were still connected. When a connection is established after being offline, any changes will be relayed to the database and the offline data will persist.

## Usage

Open the application, make sure there is a connection and make an input of some kind to initialize the application. After that, the application can be used online or offline without issue.
